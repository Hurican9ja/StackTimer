# ⏳ Stack Timer
**The Ultimate "Sequence of Time" Routine & Interval App**

Stack Timer is a professional-grade Android utility built for users who need to sequence their time. Unlike standard countdown apps, Stack Timer allows you to build a "Playlist of Time" by stacking individual segments into a single, seamless flow.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🧱 The Block Builder (Editor)
Build your routine like Lego blocks. Create individual timer segments with custom labels and durations. Drag and drop to rearrange your flow instantly.

### 📈 The Vertical Timeline (Execution)
Visualize your progress through a vertical timeline. The "Hero" card shows the current timer with a thick progress ring and monospace typography, while upcoming intervals peek from the bottom.

### 📱 Optimized for One-Handed Use
Designed with modern, large-screen phones in mind. All critical controls—Start, Stop, Reset, and Add—are anchored at the bottom "Reach Zone."

### 💓 Tactile & Auditory Transitions
Precision haptic feedback and melodic audio chimes notify you of transitions, allowing for a truly eyes-free experience during workouts or tasks.
